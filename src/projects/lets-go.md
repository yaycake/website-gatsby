#### Using Technology To Go Off-Line
Trump's administration had started defunding national parks; this inspired me to use the National Parks Service API to create a tool to find and explore America's national parks-- and the hikes, rock climbs, and camp sites accessible near or in each park. 

I also looked towards Patagonia and REI brands as leaders in using digital campaigns to encourage their communities to go off -screen and off-grid in a positive way. 

#### The Challenges
I coded in vanilla Javascript to create this web app. 

Design challenges included: creating a consistent experience despite the vast differences in photo qualities for each park profile; I landed on creating a full background photo experience to encourage the excitement of discovering or visiting a national park and hopefully highlighting their unique, natural features.
