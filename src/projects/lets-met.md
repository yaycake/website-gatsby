### Surf The Web Again
When I discovered the MetCollection digital database API, it felt like a great opportunity to build something I could use artistically. I was also looking to practice building a React app, and this-- along with Firebase-- presented a fun, creative project that was small enough to dive into and simple enough for me to practice adding features and optimizing performances using a newly learned framework. 

### The Opportunity
Search engines can help you find what you think or know you'd like to see more of, but what of discovery? 

With a push-economy of ads, algorithmically selected media, and narrowing horizon of 'tastes' mainstreamed directly into your eyeball-feed, the magic of discovering what you didn't know you liked, appreciated, or were interested is fading: you can't tell a search engine to surprise you without giving it some kind of prompt or keyword. I wanted a minimal way to browse an online gallery/collection of art spanning a variety of mediums, histories, culture, and types without having to provide a prompt.
